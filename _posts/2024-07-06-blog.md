A line drawing by me of the Majohn A2, drawn with the Majohn A2 with a custom mix of inks (Pilots Vpen Red ink mixed with some generic Erasable Royal Blue).

Yesterday (Friday the 17th of May 2024) I had the Majohn (formerly known as Moonman) A2 in “Purple with Black Clip” delivered. I had ordered this pen on a whim from AliExpress the previous Friday. ([Link](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJssaiP)) I managed to spend £7.34 with free guaranteed 7 day shipping due to a “new user” type discount for 50% off on one item.

First impressions had left me impatient to receive some Ink to use in the pen, I had ordered directly from the Diamine website on Thursday night, with 4 inks and a sample. Which will probably arrive on Monday, this was when I had expected the pen to arrive.

As international standard cartridges do not fit this pen (I believe it uses the propriety Pilot standard) I knew I would need to get ink to actually use the pen, but I misjudged the timing of things.

My impatience got the better of me and I decided to fill the included cartridge with a bastard custom mix I had previously made, which combined the Red ink from a Pilot Vpen with a generic Erasable Blue ink from a cartridge.

I think I might be in love. (Sorry Spouse)

All the items I received in the package (the smaller items were all in a tiny zip-lock bag). From left to right: Instruction Manual in Chinese and English, a basic pipette for adding ink to the cartridges, a converter (screw type), a cartridge with a rubber stopper and the Purple & Black Clip Majohn A2 (Moonman logo) with an empty cartridge pre-installed.

This brings me to what I mean by “I am a Newbie” even though I have been using fountain pens for over a decade (ah!). I have considered myself a casual enjoyer. I originally got a Schneider Voice Fountain pen around 2013? My old journals are in South Africa still so I have no way to check right now. I always go back to using a fountain pen for long form writing, as they really help with wrist pain and regulating the amount of pressure I exert on the pen/paper. That pen’s nib has permanently been ground down to the angle I wrote with it the entire time, it has now been retired after many years of abuse.

During this time I would occasionally experiment with Glass dip pens, Calligraphy pens, and the disposable Pilot Vpens. Around 2020 I got a Luxor Ink Glide pen for REALLY cheap, which led to me buying a lot more.

> I regularly gave them away as starter pens to people, as they are really cheap, at least in South Africa, and super smooth due to the wick feed mechanism, unfortunately this also means switching ink/proper cleaning is nearly impossible.

After moving to the UK my use of fountain pens diminished along with my long form journaling practice, this entire time my ink options had consisted of basic Cartridge colours from Schneider and these dirt cheap pens I was able to get my hands on, as that was all that was accessible to me in South Africa.

While visiting Edinburgh with a friend in November last year, I encountered a Platinum Preppy in a tiny stationery store called Paper Tiger (definitely worth a peek if you are in the area). I was immediately amazed at the smoothness and that started me thinking of fountain pens more. Particularly as I had started journaling daily again recently.

Beyond this though, I was using a myriad of lower quality moleskine planners and discount notebooks and generally didn’t have use for fountain pens beyond my journal (or so I thought) so I was still just using fountain pens occasionally and mostly in a specific setting. This is why I consider myself a “newbie” I have enjoyed fountain pens, but never really gotten OBSESSED as I have with a few other things. I also had no desire to really grow a bigger collection.

> To me, fountain pens were a practical writing instrument that helped me not get wrist pain while long form writing.

The catalyst was Kokuyo THIN paper. While I was in London at the end of April to see EMEI perform live ([See my journal spreads here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6yZXLXIja_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D)) I went to [The Journal Shop](https://www.thejournalshop.com/)’s physical shop in Shoreditch. While there I saw a Jibun Techo Days on sale for £14.40 and instantly bought it, as I was looking for something exactly like this for time tracking and work notes (and now it has replaced all my other planners (⌐■_■) another post to look out for?).

When I got home I tried using the ballpoint pens I had gotten used to settling for on planner paper, and then I remembered how people talk about fountain pens and Japanese paper. Pandora’s box was opened. I got obsessed. The Yellow Platinum Preppy that usually is a bit too light to read on most papers had wonderful shading! This was the first time I had experienced shading and I replaced my work notebook with a friendlier paper immediately (the MUJI High Quality Paper B6 Slim Notebook Grid, this has been my Journal paper since November 2023 as well so I had a few spares laying around) so I could use my fountain pens for everything!

Look at that Shading!!! Excuse the scratchy ballpoint, I was still working things out…

> Why the Majohn A2?

> Short answer → to stop annoying my spouse!

Long answer → using my cheaper fountain pens was okay, but, taking notes in meetings while sitting across from my spouse led to a LOT of pen fiddling, clicking the cap lid on and off constantly, and, occasionally, strike that, frequently, using the pen like a fidget toy (⌒_⌒;). I also encountered the issue of not being able to quickly take a note when I was in a meeting as I would have to recap the pen every once in a while to avoid it drying out, this also bothered me when I was doing research and had to slow down to take note of an idea I had.

For a few days I pined over the Pilot Vanishing point, but that price tag made this not an option. After the concept of a fountain pen that is retractable lived in my brain rent free for a couple of weeks (during some COVID induced delirium, the joys of traveling!), I did some more research and discovered the Majohn A series as an option on the r/fountainpens subreddit.

Comparing the three it seemed that the A2 was a good option to see if retractable fountain pens are your jam, and considering size and weight I decided I want the slightly lighter/thinner pen as an every day carry that can slip into my planner cover.

I debated at first about placing an order on AliExpress, as in South Africa ordering from these places was risky — many lost packages and multiple month long wait times — as well as the shambles that is the South African Postal Service. Reading into it more though I realised that the process was a lot easier for the UK, especially the whole tax business. Considering the price I decided to try it out. I don’t regret it at all. It was as convenient as any internal UK order I have placed, with full tracking (and a quick trip through customs that didn’t require any input from me).

One to two day delivery has spoiled me in the past nearly two years I’ve lived in the UK, but it really was worth the wait. And to paraphrase a comment I read on r/fountainpens:

> It’s a pen, I’ll have something else to write with in the mean time.

I’m already considering placing another order, I bought 4 inks from Diamine to reach the free delivery (and free sample) threshold, and I only have the one un-inked pen now (⇀_⇀), actually, technically, I have none.

I’ll share my first ever inks once they have arrived! I ordered 30ml bottles of:

- Ancient Copper
- Aurora Borealis
- Classic Green
- Tyrian Purple
- Wagner (sample only)

> Yes, in the past DECADE I have used fountain pens I have never actually bought a bottle of ink…

Blame South African Import Tax.

Let’s see if I carry on trying to blog more! Until next time. ~S
